            The American chestnut was one of the most abundant and productive
            trees in the country- having about 4.2 billion-before the emergence
            of the chestnut blight, a fungal disease that kills the trees'
            leaves, flowers, and stems. (Coincidentally, the blight was first
            discovered just across the Harlem River from Highbridge in 1904 at
            The Bronx Zoo).
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal is to plant over 1,000 native American Chestnut Trees in
            New York City and specifically in Highbridge and Central Park but
            also on sidewalks and street corners to give more life to the urban
            city

            The Long History Of Deforestation, Industrialization, and tree death

            Michael Williams When the Dutch West India Company established what
            was soon to be called Nieuw Amsterdam in 1624-1625, the island of
            Manhattan was 80 to 85 percent forested, with as many as several
            million trees covering some 10,000+ acres of its then total area of
            about 13,000 acres. What remains of this forest today is no more
            than a few thousand trees on a few hundred acres of forested
            parkland at the northern end of the island, and there are
            indications that much of the clearing of the island had in fact been
            accomplished no later than the early 18th century and possibly as
            early as the late 17th century. Is this possible? Could a town that
            had begun with just a handful of settlers in 1623–1624 and numbered
            only 7,500 souls a century later have cleared even a million trees
            from the island in 100 years or less?
          </p>

          <p>
            The truth is that wood was used majorly for fuel purposes and this
            is why we saw a decrease in forests and an increase in fields. What
            once was a rural area now is an industrial jungle. It is safe to say
            that nearly 100% of the energy requirements—heating, cooking, and
            basic manufactures—of 17th and early 18th century Nieuw Amsterdam
            and New York were met by fuelwood, the exceptions being a few wind,
            horse, and water mills, one of them a saw-mill up near today’s East
            75th Street. Houses — even the chimneys — were built mostly of wood,
            as were ships and fences. Demand for wood and wood products was so
            great that within just a few years of its founding, Nieuw Amsterdam
            was importing wood from elsewhere in the region, and traffic in wood
            was becoming an industry and a branch of commerce in its own right.

            This is why it is so fundamental not only to plant trees in
            Manhattan, but also to find new sources of fuel and cut back on
            industrializing any further

          <h1>Our Future Goals as Speakers Of The Trees</h1>
          <p>
            The following list are goals we aspire to reach in the Future of New
            York City to repopulate our native trees and promote greenery all
            over such an industrialized, urban area with so much pollution and
            cement.

            <dd>
              Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a
              push-up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the
              position as long as you can.

            <dd>
              Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on
              the floor in a push-up position, bring one knee up to your chest,
              and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing
              a mountain).
